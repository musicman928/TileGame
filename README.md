# Tile Game

## Synopsis
This is a basic engine for a tile based puzzle game based off of a japanese game called Sokoban.

## Motivation
This was made for the final project for my Object Oriented Programming 2 class.

## How to Run
The TileGame class is the main class and that's the one you should be executing to run this program.

## Credits
Thank you to Hiroyuki Imabayashi for creating the game Sokoban. It has left a very strong impact on the entirety of video games and the industry would not be the same without Sokoban.
